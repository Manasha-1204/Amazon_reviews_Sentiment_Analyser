"This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"
"This is a fast read filled with unexpected humour and profound insights into the art of politics and policy. In brief, it is sly, wry, and wise."
"I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
"I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
"I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it."
"I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
"This movie with all of its animals really keeps my grandson occupied when I'm babysitting. He loves watching it over and over again. I can get so much accomplished before he gets bored with it. So, it is worth the money! As a matter of fact, I'm buying one for his house, his 3 y/o cousins' and my house. We're saying goodbye to Netflix! Way to go Amazon!!Gammy"
"I found a copy of this cookbook at a local used book store and mixed up a sourdough starter the following day. It was bubbling away the next morning and I can't wait to try it in a few more days...The directions in this book are simple to follow. The anecdotes and history provided are entertaining. The recipes all sound delicious! I'll be working my way through many of these, starting of course with the sourdough hotcakes and bread. The handwritten format just adds to the charm of the book. If you're interested in learning to make sourdoughs, this book will give you all the information you'll need."
"The book is a basic ""how to"" book for using sourdough. The author obviously has lots of experience cooking with a sourdough starter.I would have loved more recipes, but I did go search for my more on the internet."
"I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick, which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked. The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?"
"It's a good book, but the maps are not very good, covering only parts of central areas and there aren't subway maps. Moreover there isn't anything about hostels!"
"The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
"This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions."
"I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
"My daughter absolutely loves this game! It's easy to use and requires no adult supervision. Best of all, it allows girls to use their creativity to design their own castle one room at a time. What more could a girl want! My daughter wants to play it every day and I have to find excuses to keep her away! Too bad not all the Barbie games are this easy and fun. I've been very disappointed in others I purchased. I discovered that they're not all designed/published by the same company. I paid 5.99 for this game on clearance and it's been worth 10 times this amount!"
"This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."
"NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
My 4year old really likes this game. She's not addicted to it but loves the style of the program and it is one of her favourite games. I recommend this program for 4-7 year olds. Anybody older may find it limited.
"I once purchased a 12"" of Jesse Rae's song RUSHA. I really enjoyed it and thought it might be nice to have an overview of his work. It's funny how you can remember somthing fondly only to hear it later in life and think...it's okay. Sorry, but the same is true for this recording, a bit dated, a bit tiresome, but fun."
This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!
"Written by Elizabeth Crary (a parent educator of 25 years' experience), Dealing With Disappointment: Helping Kids Cope When Things Don't Go Their Way offers parents, teachers, child care providers, and anyone else who works with children a straightforward guidance to teaching children how to meet and deal with seemingly insurmountable challenges. From learning to recognize when children are truly upset or shaken; to the dangers of trying to make or keep children happy at all times; to teaching young ones self-calming and problem-solving skills with step-by-step guides and games; to learning how to keep one's cool when the kids lose theirs, Dealing With Disappointment is an excellent and strongly recommended resource filled from cover to cover with positive and practical guidance and guidelines."
"Big Pokey is one of the best rappers out of the South. No one can do it like him. This album is a small example of what he can do on the mic. Need more proof, listen to the old Screw tapes. You must have this cd in your collection and be on the look out for that new Big Pokey coming soon!!!"
"This is an amazing blend of hot beats and a good rapper. It's underground, so many of you might be nervous about buying it. But, I'll tell you, Pokey sounds a lot like Biggie Smalls (BIG). He has biggie's style, usin words like sho nuff. Pokey's lyrics are good, but a few lyrics could use a little work. A few of his songs have complex beats, but most have a little bit of a more simple beat. The album comes together great. Get it! Trust me...its worth the money"
"These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
"These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
"THIS IS SIMPLY A GREAT ALBUM, FULLA CLASSIC BEATS AND SUPER FUTURISTIC INTELLIGENT BASS. ON OF MY FAVORITES."
"This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
works real good....a little hard to set up...web part doesnt work thru handset manager as advertised.....have to go into networking and turn it on
It is a quality ball but the small is still too big and heavy for my little yorkie to play with comfortably.
"I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans."
"Y TAMBIEN LA VIDA INTIMA DE LOS TRIUNFADORES...Por eso me fascinÃ³ este libro que me regalÃ³ mi esposa !Y seguro a mis cuantes tambien..porque alguno de ellos me ""incautÃ³ "" el libro !YA DEVUELVELO, BRO!"
"Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold..."
In a world where media is dominant this movie is so refreshing as it chronicles the agony of a person who yearns for God. Watch it! 0:)
"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
"This book is quite touching. It tells Dorie's story of all the unbelievably horribe things she experience while growing up being abused both physially and sexually. It gives hope to those who believe that no one's situation is as bad as their's or those who think recovery is not possible. If you are looking for self help to enhance you own healing journey this book is probably not what you need if you dont fall into the above categories. However, it is a great testimony to be aware of."
"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
"Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
"This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
