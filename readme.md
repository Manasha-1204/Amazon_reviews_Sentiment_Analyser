# Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to develop a Streamlit app capable of analyzing sentiments in various scenarios, including single-line reviews, multiple reviews from CSV files, and product reviews from Amazon URLs.

## Project Structure

- **B8_Amazon**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **reviewscrapper.py**: Includes Python scripts for web scraping reviews for a certain URL.
- **review_analyzer.py**: Houses the Streamlit app code for interactive sentiment analysis.
- **models.p**: Stores serialized models for sentiment analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the project dependencies for reproducibility.
- **config.toml**: Configuration for the Streamlit app theme.
